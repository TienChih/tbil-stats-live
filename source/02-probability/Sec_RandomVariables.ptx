<introduction>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="Sec_Center"/>, and <xref ref="Sec_Variation"/> we found how to find the mean, variance and a standard deviation of a finite population.  Then previously in this chapter, we studied the probability of individual events either happening or not happening.  In this section, we look at the collection of outcomes of random process, and measure centrality and spread of these processes.

    <definition>
        <p>
          A <em>random variable</em> random process or variable with a numerical outcome.
        </p>
      </definition>

      <remark>
        <p>
        Given a random variable <m>X</m> with a finite number of outcomes, we denote them <m>X_1,\ldots,X_n</m>, and the probability that <m>X</m> takes on the value <m>X_i</m> is <m>P(X=X_i)</m>..
      </p>
      <p>
        Then since these are all the possible probabilities we have:
        <ol>
          <li><m>0\leq P(X=X_i)\leq 1</m></li>
          <li><m>\sum P(X=X_i)=1</m></li>
