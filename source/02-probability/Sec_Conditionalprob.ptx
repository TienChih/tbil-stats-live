    <title>Conditional Probability (P2)</title>
<introduction>
<p>
  Let's say you know the probability you get into a car accident while driving.  Then it starts snowing, would that change what we think the likelihood of accidents are?  Lung cancer occurs at a certain rate, but if you knew someone smoked, would that affect how you feel about the likelihood of lung cancer?
</p>

<p>
  We define <em>conditional probability</em> to be the likelihood of some event <m>A</m> <em>given</em> (or <em>conditioned</em>, <em>assuming</em> etc.) some other event <m>B</m>.  Sometimes, this information can raise, lower, or leave unchanged our understanding of the likelihood of <m>A</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this section we compute and interpret probability of events involving conditional probabilities.

      We say the probability of <m>A</m> <term>given</term> <m>B</m> is the probability <m>A</m>occurs assuming that <m>B</m> occurs, denoted <m>P(A|B)</m>.

<remark>
  <p>
    We think of two events as <q>independent</q> if knowing the outcome of one event will not change how we think of the outcome of another event.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, <q>It rains today</q> and <q>I flip a coin and get a heads</q>.  The chance of getting that heads remains unchanged whether or not it rains!</p>

    <p>
      In general, it's hard to know if two events are independent or not!  Things may seem unrelated, but share hidden connections and causes.  The world is a complicated place!</p>
