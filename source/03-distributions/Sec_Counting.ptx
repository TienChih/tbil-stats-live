          <title>Breakfast Choices</title>
      
      <introduction>
          <p>Suppose you were eating breakfast, and you could choose from eggs, sausage or pancakes to eat, and coffee and juice to drink. </p>
          
      </introduction>

      <task>
          <p>List all of the possible food-beverage choices you could make.  (Assume you can't skip either, and can only have one food idea and one beverage.)</p>

        <introduction>
            <p>
One of the most useful counting tools in mathematics is the <term>multiplication principle</term>.
This principle is used when all the items to be counted come from a sequence of choices.
If each item is made by making a choice from <m>a</m> things, then a choice from <m>b</m> things,
then a choice from <m>c</m> things, and so on, then the total number of items is given by the product:
            </p>
            <me>
a\cdot b\cdot c\cdot \cdots
            </me>
            
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Suppose for a fancy dinner you are given four options as an appetizer, six options as an entree,
three options as a beverage, and two options as a dessert. How many different dinners are possible?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Suppose you could choose an appetizer or a dessert, but not both. How many different dinners
are possible in that scenario?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
What if instead you consider the choice to skip any part of the meal, holding the appetizer, entree,
beverage, and/or dessert. How many dinners are possible in that case?
            </p>
        </task>

What is the size of the sample space for the experiment of rolling
a six sided die, then flipping a coin, then drawing a card from a shuffled 52-card deck?

    A <term>permutation</term> is an ordered arrangement of objects.  In partcular, a <m>r</m> permutation on an <m>n</m> element set is a selection of <m>r </m> objects from this set and arranged.

  <remark>
  <statement>

      We note that <m>n!</m> denotes <m>n!=\overbrace{n\cdot (n-1)\cdots 1}^{n}</m> where we let <m>0!=1</m>.

    <remark>
  
    <p>
      Here are some useful facts about combinations.
      <ul>
        <li> <m>C(n,n)=1</m>.  There is only one way to pick <m>n</m> of <m>n</m> objects.  Pick them all.</li>
        <li> <m>C(n,r)=C(n,n-r)</m>.  Picking <m>r</m> objects is the same as selecting <m>n-r</m> objects to <em>not</em> pick. </li>
        <li> <m>C(n,0)=1</m>.  Combine the above facts.  Alternatively, the only selection of no objects is the empty selection.</li>
