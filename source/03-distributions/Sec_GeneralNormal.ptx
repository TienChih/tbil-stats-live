    <title>General Normal Distribution (D2)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p>We begin our discussion with the standard normal distribution to build intuition about normal distributions, but most naturally occuring normally distributed things do not have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Things that are generally normally distributed may have any mean and standard deviation, but what makes them normally distributed is that they have the <em>same fundamental shape</em> as the standard normal, a bell curved symmetric shape.  In the standard normal curve, the standard deviation is 1, so the units of <m>z</m> are standard deviations.  We can translate values from any <m>X</m> normally distributed random variable to the standard distribution through <term><m>z</m>-scores</term>.</p>

        <p>
        In this section, we will compute probabilities of general normal random variables given bounds, and bounds given probabilities.

  <p>
  Given a random variable <m>X</m> with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, the <term><m>z</m>-score</term> of a value <m>x</m> of <m>X</m> is the number of standard deviations <m>x</m> is above or below the mean.  This is computed <me>z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}.</me>

<remark>
  <p>
    Consider a normal distribution with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, often denoted <m>N(\mu, \sigma)</m>.  every value <m>x</m> in <m>N(\mu, \sigma)</m> has a corresponding <m>z</m>-score in <m>N(0,1)</m>.  So for a random variable <m>X</m> which has distribution <m>N(\mu, \sigma)</m>, we can find <m>P(a\lt X\lt b)</m> by finding <m>P(z_a\lt Z\lt z_b)</m> in <m>N(0,1)</m> where <m>z_a, z_b></m> are the <m>z</m>-scores of <m>a, b</m>.
    <interactive desmos="0znk7lhy30"/>  

  </p>

  <p>
    This is because all normal curves are transformations of the same curve, so every point on one curve corresponds to a point on the other, as do regions and their areas.
