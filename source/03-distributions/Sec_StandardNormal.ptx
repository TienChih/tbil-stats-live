    <title>Standard Normal Distribution (D1)</title>
<introduction>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In this section, we study one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental probability distributions in nature and mathematics: the <term>normal distribution</term>.  We may know this as the standard <q>bell curve</q>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this section, we will compute probabilities of the standard normal random variable given bounds, and bounds given probabilities.

    <definition>
      <p>
        The <term>standard normal curve</term> is the curve generated by <me>y=\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}.</me>
        This may be seen below.  It is a probability distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

   <remark>
    <p>
      Given the standard normal curve, the probability that a normal variable <m>Z</m> falls between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is <m>P(a\lt Z\lt b)</m> and is computed by the area under the curve between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

    <p>
      <em>ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS</em> sketch a curve and label any values/areas that you can before doing any computations when working with normal curves.

  <remark>
    <p>
      Seriously, always sketch a curve first, the geometric intuition will tell you so much more than just doing arithmetic blindly.

      <title>Computing Probabilities on the Normal Curve</title>
      <introduction>
          <p>Areas under this curve are difficult to compute directly, so generally, technology of some sort is employed to find these values.

  <title>Some things to keep in mind</title>
   <p>
   Here are some quick facts and heuristics about the normal curve to give you an intuitive sense on how it behaves.
   <ul>
      <li> Each half is 50% of the curve, so have greater than the mean, half less than the mean.</li>
      <li> For any tail of the distribution, the corresponding tail on the other side has the same area.</li>
      <li> Roughly 67% of the curve lies within <m>\pm 1</m> standard deviations from the mean,  95% within <m>\pm 2</m> standard deviations from the mean, and 99.7% within <m>\pm 3</m> standard deviations from the mean.</li>
   </ul>
