    <title>Variation of Data (B5)</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Knowing averages or center of data sets only tells part of the story.  We also should know how the data <em>varies</em> or <em>spread</em>.  As in the idea of averages,  there are different ways to approach this. 

  </p>


  <p>
    In this section, we will show how to identify and compute different notions of variations.

  Run the following code to download the <c>ncbirths.csv</c> data set:

  <sage language="r">

            ncbirths = read.csv("https://github.com/TienChih/tbil-stats/raw/main/data/ncbirths.csv")

  In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample of 1,000 cases from this data set.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Often we are interested in the <term>spread</term> of values in a dataset. The simplest
measure of spread is the <term>range</term> of data: the difference between its
largest value (its <term>maximum</term>) and its smallest value (its <term>minimum</term>).
For example, the range of the values in
<m>3,3,6,7,12,12,16,19</m> is <m>\text{max}-\text{min}=19-3=16</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Find the maximum, minimum, and range for the values
<m>9, 2, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 8</m>.

    <title>Measuring the Spread of Data</title>
<introduction>
    <p>Intuitively, we likely think of the <q>spread</q> as a sort of summed distance of data points from the center of the data.  The more points are far away from the center, or the farther away they are, the more <q>spread</q> out the data is.  We will walk through a formulation of this notion.</p>

    <p>As a proposed measure of spread, compute a sum of all these values: <m>(1-\bar{x})+ (2-\bar{x})+ (3-\bar{x})+ (4-\bar{x})+ (5-\bar{x}) </m>.</p>

    <p>What do you think of the proposed measure we computed?  What, if anything, may be wrong with it? </p>

<task>
    <p>Consider the data set <c>T=[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]</c>.  Compute the mean of <m>T, \bar{x}'</m>.  Do we think <m>T</m> is more, less or equally spread out than <m>S</m>?</p>

<definition xml:id="definition-popvariance">
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> The <em> population variance</em>  of a data set is a measure of <q>spread</q> denoted by <me>V_P:=\frac{\sum (x_i-\mu)^2}{n} </me></li>

      <li> A theoretically useful measure of spread with the same units as the original variable would be the <em>population standard deviation</em> denoted by  <me>\sigma:=\sqrt{V_P}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i-\mu)^2}{n}} </me></li>
