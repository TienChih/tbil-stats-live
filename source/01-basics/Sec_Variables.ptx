  <title>Types of Variables and their Relationships (B1)</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When one does statistics, what is it exactly that we are observing and measuring?  What are we computing?
    </p>
  <p>
    In this section, we recognize different types of variables and classify them, and describe potential relationships between variables in a data set.

  <exploration xml:id="exploration-sleep">
      <title>Hours of sleep</title>
      <introduction>
      <p>
        In this introductory activity, we ask ourselves some natural questions that one would ask when collecting and analyzing data.
      </p>
    </introduction>

        <task>
          <p>
          As a class write down the average time (in hours, to the nearest half-hour) they sleep per night. </p>
        </task>

        <task>
          <p>
            Then create a simple graph (called a dot plot) of the data. 
      For example, consider the following data:

<me>5, 5.5, 6, 6, 6, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9</me>

The dot plot for this data would be as follows:

  <figure>
  <image source="images/DotPlot.png" width="75%" >
      <description>Frequency of Average Time (in Hours) Spent Sleeping per Night.</description>

    </image>
<caption> Frequency of Average Time (in Hours) Spent Sleeping per Night.</caption>
</figure>
</p>
</task>

<task>
<p>
Does your dot plot look the same as or different from the example? Why?
</p>
</task>

<task>
<p>
 If you did the same exercise in an English class with the same number of students, do you think the results would be the same? Why or why not?
</p>
</task>

      <task>
<p>
  Where do your data appear to cluster? How could you interpret the clustering?
</p>
</task>
      <task>
<p>
  What could we say about the Average Sleeping time of other students at your school?  Would it matter if they were taking Statistics?  Why or why not?
</p>
</task>
      <task>
<p> What are some reasons one may doubt the conclusions you've reached?
</p>
</task>

  <title>Types of Variables</title>
  <p>
  When we do either descriptive or inferential statistics, we are describing or infering properties of <em>variables</em>.  Variables come in two types, each with two subcategories.</p>

<definition>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      <em>Numerical</em> variables are variables who's values are representable as numbers which can meaningfully be summed, subtracted or averaged.
      <ul>
        <li> <em>Discrete</em> variables have values spaced out by regular units, typically whole number value.</li>
        <li><em>Continuous</em> variables have values where number between values are also potential values.</li>
      </ul>  
    </p>
  </li>
      <li><p>

        <em>Categorical</em> variables have values that are categories rather than numerical.
      
        <ul>
          <li><em>Ordinal</em> variables have values which have a natural ranking.</li>
          <li><em>Nominal</em> variables do not exhibit a natural ranking.</li>
         </ul>  
       </p>
         </li>

  </ul>  

</definition>

  <activity xml:id="activity-variables">
      <title>Classifying Variables</title>
      <task>
        <p>
          For each of the following, classify the variable type and subcategory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>The colors of crayons in a 24-crayon box.</li>
            <li>Student ID Numbers.</li>
            <li>Grade Point Averages.</li>
            <li>Pounds of fish caught on a fishing trip.</li>
            <li>Number of fish caught on a fishing trip.</li>
            <li>Year of Birth.</li>
            <li>Annual income in dollars.</li>
            <li>A satisfaction survey of a social website by number: 1 = very satisfied, 2 = somewhat satisfied, 3 = not satisfied.</li>

        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Then, for each of the four subcategories, come up with two additional examples.

  <activity xml:id="activity-variablesR">
      <title>Classifying Variables from a Data Set</title>
      <introduction>
            <p>
              In this activity, we look at an actual sample of data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Run the following code to download the <c>heart_transplant.csv</c> data and to display it.
        <sage language="r">
          <input>
            heart_transplant = read.csv("https://github.com/TienChih/tbil-stats/raw/main/data/heart_transplant.csv")
            heart_transplant
          </input>
        </sage>
        This data is from a Stanford University study to see if an experimental heart transplant procedure increased lifespan.
        </p>
      </introduction>
        <task>
        <p>  
          Run <c>names(heart_transplant)</c> to see just the variable names.

        <sage language="r">
          <input>
            names(heart_transplant)
          </input>
        </sage>

        The meaning of these variables are:
        <ul>
        <li>id - ID number of the patient.</li>
        <li>acceptyear - Year of acceptance as a heart transplant candidate.</li>
        <li>age - Age of the patient at the beginning of the study.</li>
        <li>survived - Survival status with levels alive and dead.</li>
        <li>survtime - Number of days patients were alive after the date they were determined to be a candidate for a heart transplant until the termination date of the study</li>
        <li>prior - Whether or not the patient had prior surgery with levels yes and no.</li>
        <li>transplant - Transplant status with levels control (did not receive a transplant) and treatment (received a transplant).</li>
        <li>wait - Waiting Time for Transplant</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
    </task>


        <task>
        <p>  
          
        For each variable in this data set, which type and subcategory is it?
        </p>
        </task> 
          

      
  </activity>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-relationship">
<title>Relationships Between Variables</title>
  <p>
    Much of data analysis is centered on not one, but two or more variables at the same time, to observe any relationships (or lack thereof) between variables.


  </p>

  <p>
    To facilitate this, we often plot pairs of numerical varaibles as <em>scatterplots</em> where the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates are each different numerical variables.  When then look for patterns in the resulting plot.

  </p>

  <activity xml:id="activity-popchangeincome">
    <title>Population Change vs Per Capita Income</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
  Consider the following figure comparing change in County's population compared to their median household income.
  
  <figure>
  <image source="images/popincome" width="75%" >
      <description>Change in popultation vs change in per capita income</description>

    </image>
<caption> Change in population of a county versus  median household income of the same county.  Owsley
County of Kentucky, is highlighted, which lost 3.63% of its population from 2010
to 2017 and had median household income of $22,736. </caption>
</figure>
</p>
</introduction>

  <task>
        <p>  
           Does there seem to be a positive, negative, or no relationship between the change in population and the median household income?
         </p>
       </task>

    <task>
        <p>  
          Is this relationship (if any) strong or weak? 
        </p>
      </task>

    <task>
        <p>  
          What might account for this relationship, or lack of relationship? 
        </p>
      </task>
  </activity>

  <p>
  A relationship between variables of this sort is often referred to as <em>correlation</em>.

    <title>Multi-unit Housing Vs. Home Ownership</title>
