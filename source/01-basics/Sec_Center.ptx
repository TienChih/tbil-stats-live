<introduction>
  <p>
    When using data to make predictions about random variables, it is useful to be able to discuss the notion of central or <q>average</q> values of that data.  There are different ways to approach this. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this section, we will show how to identify and compute different notions of centrality.

  Run the following code to download the <c>ncbirths.csv</c> data set:

  <sage language="r">
          <input>
            ncbirths = read.csv("https://github.com/TienChih/tbil-stats/raw/main/data/ncbirths.csv")

  In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample of 1,000 cases from this data set.

        <introduction>
            <p>
There are several notions of <q>average</q>, that is, several ways to describe the
center of a dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
Most commonly, <q>average</q> is used to describe the <term>mean</term> of a dataset.
If a dataset contains the <m>n</m> values <m>x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}</m>, then the
mean is defined by the following formula:
            </p>
            <me>
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{0\leq k&lt; n} x_k = \frac{x_0+x_1+\dots+x_{n-1}}{n}
            </me>
            <p>
For example, the mean of the counting numbers <m>2,3,5,7,18</m> is <m>\frac{2+3+5+7+18}{5}=7</m>:
all the values in the collection are added together, and then divided by the amount of data
in the collection.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Show that <m>8</m> is the mean of the counting numbers <m>4,8,9,11</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Is it possible for the mean of a dataset to not belong to the dataset itself?
If so, give an example of such a dataset. If not, explain why.

When data is ordered from least to greatest, the middle value is called its <term>median</term>.
For example, the median of <m>1,1,6,7,9</m> is <m>6</m>.
