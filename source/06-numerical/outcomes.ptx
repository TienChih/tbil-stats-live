N: Can I perform inference for numerical variables?

N1: I can compute and interpret probabilities given bounds, and bounds given probabilities for  standard <m>t</m>-variables.

N5: I can find the sample size of a numerical variables needed to find confidence intervals with given margin of errors, and detect differences in means given a power.

N6: I can use ANOVA to test if variation between groups can be explained solely through the variation within groups and explain the results.
