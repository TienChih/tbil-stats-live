    <title>Size of Samples of Numerical Variables (N5)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> In often, gathering data, conducting experiments or studies, and performing statistical analysis can be time consuming, arduous or expensive.  If we wish to achieve a certain level of precision in our results, we need samples of sufficient size.  We've done this for categorical variables in <xref ref="Sec_SizeofSampleCat"/>  In this section, we estimate the minimum size of a sample which will provide the precision of our choice for <em>numerical</em> variables.

        <title>Sample Size and Margins of Error</title>

        <remark xml:id="remark-sizeofsampnumCI">
          <p>
            In <xref ref="remark-numCI"/> we spoke about computing confidence intervals for the means of numerical variables.  Recall from <xref ref="definition-MoEprop"/> that the margin of error for a confidence interval is the distance from the endpoints of the interval to it's center, or <m>\frac{UB-LB}{2}</m>.  Since a numerical confidence interval is computed as: <me>\left[\bar{x}-t^*\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x}+t^*\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right]</me> from <xref ref="remark-numCI"/>, the margin of error of a numerical confidence interval is <me>ME=t^*\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.</me>

        We know from the computation of the standard error that the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error.  A moderate sample may be able to detect moderate differences in means, but be unable to detect smaller differences.  For that, we would need to find a bigger sample.

      So, this isn't fantastic.  Turns out there is a real difference in the efficacy of these two medications, but it's simply to small for our study to reliably detect.  The researchers may not know that this difference in the medication exists, but they're certainly aware that something like this could be an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem fundamentally is that the standard error <m>SE</m> is simply to large, and the test is thus insensitive to this difference.  Since <me>SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n}+\frac{s_2^2}{n}}</me> we could shrink the standard error by increasing <m>n</m> and taking a larger sample.  But we can't just keep testing bigger and bigger groups, there are time and financial limitations.  Also the researchers don't know there is a difference to be found, and don't want their time looking for a difference that doesn't exist.

           <introduction>
               <p>
                 A nonprofit organization wants to test which data-entry system saves the most time for their volunteers.  They recruit an equal number of volunteers to test systems A and B.  The standard deviation of time spent in data entry is 45 minutes for both methods.  Suppose they wish to detect a difference of 15 minutes.
