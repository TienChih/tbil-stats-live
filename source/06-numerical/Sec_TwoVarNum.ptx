                 In <xref ref="exploration-ncbirthssmoke"/>, we saw that there was an observable difference in the average baby weights of the samples.

      Let there be two random numerical variables, with population means <m>, \mu_1, \mu_2</m> and standard deviations <m>\sigma_1. \sigma_2</m>.  Then let <m>D</m> be the random variable generated by taking random samples of size <m>n_1, n_2</m> of the two variables and taking the difference in their proportions.  Then <m>D</m> is approximated by a normal variable with mean and standard deviation: <me>\mu_D=\mu_1-\mu_2, SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}.</me>

  <p>
    As in <xref ref="remark-numCI"/>, given samples of two numerical variables, of sizes <m>n_1, n_2</m> with sample means <m>\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_2</m> and standard deviations <m>s_1, s_2</m>, we can find a C% confidence interval for the difference of population means <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m> by <me>[(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)-t^*SE_D, (\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)+t^*SE_D]</me> where <m>SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}</m> as in <xref ref="remark-diffofmeans"/>, and <m>t^*</m> is the <m>t</m> value so that <m>P(-t^*\lt t \lt t^*)=C\%</m> for a <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>\min(n_1, n_2)-1</m> degrees of freedom.

    Note that other techniques to do compute confidence intervals utilize a more complicated method to determine degrees of freedom.  We use this method for hand computations as it's straightforward and still a good approximation.

  <title>Hypothesis Testing</title>


<remark xml:id="remark-numHTtwo">
  <p>
    We can test the <em>difference</em> between means of numerical variables, similar to how we tested difference of proportions in <xref ref="remark-hypothesistestdiffofprop"/>.  Given two numerical variables with population means <m>\mu_1, \mu_2</m> we have alternative Hypothesis  in the forms:
    <ul>
      <li><m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2>\mu_0.</m></li>
      <li><m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\lt\mu_0.</m></li>
      <li><m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\neq\mu_0.</m></li>
      </ul>
      The null hypothesis for these is <li><m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=\mu_0.</m></li>
    </p>

    <p>
      We find <m>p</m>-values in much the same way as in <xref ref="remark-numericalHT"/>.  We assume the null hypothesis, and let <m>D</m> be the sampling distribution of the differences of the means of two samples, sizes <m>n_1, n_2</m>.  Then <m>D</m> would have mean <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m> and standard deviation <me>SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}</me> as in <xref ref="remark-diffofmeans"/>, and <m>t^*</m> is the <m>t</m> value so that <m>P(-t^*\lt t \lt t^*)=C\%</m> for a <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>\min(n_1, n_2)-1</m> degrees of freedom (again a simplified heurisitic).

  </p>
  <p>
    Then based on the alternative hypothesis, we compute the tail area(s) exactly as we would in <xref ref="remark-hypothesistestdiffofprop"/>.

                Dairy farmers wish to test a new type of diets for dairy cows, with the hope that the new diet will increase milk yields.  20 cows are fed the traiditional diet and 15 the experimental diet.  The cows are observed over a 4 week period, and the average daily milk yield and sample standard deviations for both groups are recorded in Liters.
