    <title>ANOVA: Analysis of Variation (N6)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> In <xref ref="Sec_TwoVarNum"/>, we compared populations seperated into two groups to see if some variable differed on average between the groups.  In this section, we will look at comparing across more than two groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose you had variable of interest across <m>k</m> seperate populations.  So long as the following conditions are met:

          <ul>
            <li>Observations are independent across groups.</li>
            <li>Observations within groups are approximately normal.</li>
            <li>Variability across groups is roughly equal.</li>
          </ul>

          Then we may perform ANOVA (Analysis of Variation) to perform a test on the following hypothesis:
          <ul>
            <li><m>H_0:</m> The means are the same across groups, that is: <m>\mu_1=\mu_2\cdots=\mu_k</m>.</li>
            <li><m>H_A::</m> At least one of the means is different from another.</li> 
          </ul>

<subsection>
  <title>Intuition of ANOVA</title>

  <remark>
    <title>Idea behind ANOVA</title>
    <p>
      The null hypothesis of ANOVA testing is that all of the groups have identical distributions, and the alternative is that they do not.  <em>If</em> the null hypothesis were true, then it must follow that all the variation between the groups is driven by the natual variation of the variable itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what we will do is compare the variation <em>between</em> groups, and variation <em>within</em> groups.  If the null hypothesis holds, them we would expect that these values are comparable.  If there is some discrepency, then we become more suspicious of the null.  As usual, this level of suspicion will be measured with a <m>p</m>-value, which measure the probability that: should the null be true that we see the levels of discrepency or greter than what's observed.

            <li>On the other hand, if <m>MSG</m> is big compared to <m>MSE</m>, then there is a lot of variability between groups.  More than the natural variation can explain.  There is likely some <em>actual</em> differences between the groups.  In these cases, <m>F</m> is big, the tails are small and so are the <m>p</m>-values.

      Note that none of the steps in <xref ref="remark-ANOVAsteps"/> are particularly difficult, just long and tedious.

By entering the group sizes, sample means and sample standard deviations into <c>N</c>, <c>M</c>, <c>S</c> below, one can compute all the necessary values:
