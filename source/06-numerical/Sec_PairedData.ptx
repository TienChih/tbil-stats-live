        <p> In this section, we consider differences in numerical data between populations where there is a natural pairing between the populations.

      <title>UCLA Bookstore vs Amazon</title>

      <introduction>
          <p>
             The authors of the excellent OpenIntro Statistics text noticed that their text was much more expensive at the UCLA bookstore than on Amazon in 2010.  Since then, more bookstores have transitioned to the online model, and have adapted to Amazon's presence in the marketplace.  Is there any average difference between UCLA and Amazon prices now?
</p>
        <p>
                Run the following code to download  the <c>textbooks.csv</c> data set which contains information about 73 textbooks sold by both the UCLA bookstore and Amazon, and display the variables:

                <sage language="r">

        <p>
          We say two sets of observations from two different populations are <em>paired</em> if:
          <ul>
            <li>The observations are of the same size.</li>
            <li>There is a <em>special</em> or <em>natural</em> relationship or pairing between each data point of one set and a data point of the other.</li>
          </ul>
          So in <xref ref="exploration-bookstore"/> the natural pairing is between prices of the same book.

        <title>Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals with Paired Data</title>
        <p>
          If you have a collection of paired data, say <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m> and <m>y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n</m>, this gives rise to a natural difference variable <m>d=x-y</m>:
          <me>
          \begin{array}{|c|c||c|}
          \hline
          \mathbf{x} \amp \mathbf{y} \amp \mathbf{d}\\
          \hline
          x_1 \amp y_1 \amp d_1=x_1-y_1\\
          x_2 \amp y_2 \amp d_2=x_2-y_2\\

        The difference between these variables is <em>itself</em> a random variable, with a population mean <m>\mu_{d}</m> and population standard deviation <m>\sigma_{d}</m>.  We can then perform any one variable numerical inference exactly as in we were in <xref ref="Sec_OneVarNum"/>.  We just have to properly interpret what statements about the difference mean:
        <ul>
          <li>A C% <em>confidence interval</em> for <m>\mu_d</m> is an interval that has a C% chance of containing the average difference between our two populations.</li>
          <li> The null hypothesis <m>\mu_d=\mu_0</m> is the assumption that the average difference between the two populations could be <m>\mu_0</m>.</li>
          <li> The alternative hypothesis <m>\mu_d\lt \mu_0</m> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is less than <m>\mu_0</m>.</li>
          <li> The alternative hypothesis <m>\mu_d> \mu_0</m> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is greater than <m>\mu_0</m>.</li>
          <li> The alternative hypothesis <m>\mu_d\neq \mu_0</m> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is different from <m>\mu_0</m>.</li>
