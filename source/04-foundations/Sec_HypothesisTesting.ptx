              <p>
                    You and a friend each day flip a coin to see which one of you buys lunch.  You always choose heads, and your friend chooses tails.  After 25 coin flips, it has come up heads 16 times.  Your friend claims that this coin you use is biased and untrustworthy.  You disagree.

              <introduction>
                  <p>
                    Your friend has a point in this case: heads has come up quite a few times, more than half for sure, and they may be right to suspect that the coin may favor heads.  On the other hand, it's possible to get 16 coin flips out of 25 just by chance.  But is this a common event, or an event so rare that it's more likely the coin is biased?

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In essence, your friends is claiming that the proportion of coin flips which come up heads isn't a half, or <m>p\neq 0.5</m>.  Your assertion is that this result could come from a fair coin and it's possible <m>p=0.5</m> despite this outcome.

          <remark>
            <p>
              The 95% confidence interval is a range of values, so that the actual proportion of heads has a 95% chance of being in the interval.  Since 0.5 is in this interval, we can't rule out the probability that the coin really is fair.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that we <em>have not proven the coin is fair</em>.  After all, there are many values in this interval other than 0.5  There's also the 5% chance that the proportion of heads this coin will show is outside of this interval, which is small, but not 0.  
            </p>

            <p>
              But the evidence certainly isn't strong enough to rule out that the coin is fair.  So we accept the coin may be fair, since we fail to show strong enough evidence that it isn't.

                    Your friend insists on flipping their own coin.  So you switch to their coin, and over the next 50 days, it only shows a heads 7 times.  Now <em>you</em> start to question the fairness of this coin, and your friends defends it.

            <p>
              With the new confidence interval, since 0.5 is not in this interval, we can say that it's extremely unlikely that the coin is fair, and you are right in your suspicions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that we technically <em>have not proven the coin is biased</em>.  There's still the 5% chance that the proportion of heads this coin will show is outside of this interval.
            </p>

            <p>
              But this is a highly unlikely event, given the evidence, we reject the idea that the coin could be fair, and accept that coin is likely biased.

            When presented with a possible claim, the <em>Null Hypothesis</em> is the skeptical perspective, and presents a claim to be tested.  The <em>Alternative Hypothesis</em> is the presented claim which we give credence to if the Null is rejected.

        </definition>

        <remark xml:id="remark-jury">
          <p>
            In a jury trial, we always presume that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty.  The default state is not guilty unless the evidence is sufficient to change this verdict.</p>

            <p>Similarly, in a hypothesis test, the <em>Null Hypothesis</em> (<m>H_0</m>)is analagous to the default claim of not guilty.  It is the claim that any presented evidence is just the product of random chance.  The <em>Alternative Hypothesis</em> (<m>H_A</m>) is analagous to the guilty verdict, in which case the evidence provided is sufficiently strong to reject the <em>Null</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that in a jury trial, the veridcts are <q>guilty</q> and <q>not guilty</q>.  Innocence is not the goal of the defense, since it is the burden of the state to present evidence sufficiently strong to invalidate a not-guilty claim.  It is <em>not</em> their responsibility to prove innocence.</p>

            <p>Similarly, accepting the Null Hypothesis in a hypothesis test <em>is not the same as saying the Null Hypothesis is true</em>.  It merely means that the evidence provided is not strong enough to convincingly say otherwise.  The Null Hypothesis could very well be false, but your evidence is too weak to say so.  As a Statistics practioner, your job is to analyze the evidence and see if it is strong enough to invalidate the Null.

            <p>
              In <xref ref="exploration-BadCoin"/> the claim is that the coin is not fair, and the default state is that the coin <em>is</em> fair.  If we let <m>p</m> denote the proportion of coin flips which will come up heads, we have:

              In the case of <xref ref="exploration-BadCoin"/>, the evidence was not sufficiently strong to reject <m>H_0</m> so we accept that the coin may be fair.  (Again, the coin may not be fair, but our evidence isn't strong enough to say so.)
            </p>

            <p>
              In <xref ref="exploration-NewCoin"/> the claim is again that the coin is not fair, and the default state is that the coin <em>is</em> fair.  If we let <m>p</m> denote the proportion of coin flips which will come up heads, we have:

              In the case of <xref ref="exploration-NewCoin"/>, the evidence was strong  enough to reject <m>H_0</m>.  Thus we can say that the coin is not fair.  Since the 95% confidence interval falls <em>below</em> 0.5, we can say <m>p\lt 0.5</m> and the coin favors tails.

            It is of course possible that in rejecting or accepting the Null Hypothesis that we make an error, either because the evidence was insufficiently strong or was just skewed by random chance.  We can quantify those errors:

              <li>If the Null Hypothesis is true and we reject it, this is a <em>Type 1 error</em>.</li>

          <remark>
            <p>
              When doing proportional hypothesis testing, there are three types of Alternative Hypothesis:
              <ul>
                <li><m>H_A: p\neq p_0</m></li>
                <li><m>H_A: p>p_0</m></li>
                <li><m>H_A: p\lt p_0</m></li>
              </ul>
              Corresponding to <q>the population proportion is (not equal to/greater than/less than) <m>p_0</m></q> for some value <m>p_0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In all of these cases, the Null Hypothesis will be: <m>H_0: p=p_0</m>, that is, the population proportion could be <m>p_0</m>.

      It's also worth noting that for either of these tails, <m>P(X>p_0+|\hat{p}-p_0|)=P(X\lt p_0-|\hat{p}-p_0|)</m>   and <m>P(Z> |z_{\hat{p}}|)=P(Z\lt -|z_{\hat{p}}|)</m>.  So if you find one of these tails, you can double it to find the sum of both tails.

            <title>The Steps of Hypothesis Testing</title>
            <p>
              When doing hypothesis testing, you should be given:
              <ul>
                <li>A parameter of interest.</li>
                <li>A sample to determine a point estimate and a size for the sample.</li>
                <li>A question to be asked about the parameter of interest.</li>
                <li>A <em>level of significance</em> often denoted <m>\alpha</m>, which reflects how willing you are to risk accepting an alternative hypothesis if you are wrong.  Typically this level of significance is <m>\alpha=0.05</m> or 5%.  The higher the significance, the more willing you are willing to risk being wrong when claiming <m>H_A</m>, the lower the significance, the less likely we are to reject the Null.  So lower levels of significance corresponds to stronger demand for evidence.</li>.
              </ul>

              Then the steps are:
              <ol>
                <li>Determine specifically both <m>H_A</m>, and <m>H_0</m>.</li>
                <li>Compute the point estimate.  (<m>\hat{p}</m>)</li>
                <li> Assume <m>H_0</m> and compute the sampling distribution  (mean  <m>\mu_{\hat{p}}</m> and standard deviation <m>SE_{\hat{p}}</m>).</li>
                <li>Compute the <m>p</m>-value via <xref ref="definition-pvalue"/> based on your <m>H_A</m>.</li>
                <li><p>Compare the <m>p</m>-value to the level of significance <m>\alpha</m>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>If <m>\alpha\leq </m> <m>p</m>-value, then we <em>fail to reject</em> the Null Hypothesis (and must accept that it <em>could</em> be true.)</li>
                    <li>If <m>\alpha > </m> <m>p</m>-value, then we <em>reject</em> the Null Hypothesis.</li>

              To summarize what we just did:</p>
              <p>We believe that more than 50% of voters support our candidiate.  <em>If</em> only 50% of supporters support our candidiate, then the probability that we could sample <m>n=212</m> candidiates and have <m>\hat{p}=\frac{122}{212}</m> or more support her is less than 5%, which is not very likely.  Thus we reject the Null and claim that more than 50% of the voters support her.
