    <title>Point Estimates (F1)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> We now begin combining the concepts learned in previous chapters to get to the real heart of statistics.  <em>Variables</em> that occur in the world that we care about are <em>Random Variables</em> that we discuss in <xref ref="Chap_Probability"/>.  But we almost never can work with the variable directly, just a sample of data from that variable as in <xref ref="Chap_DataBasics"/>.  We will use what we learned about <xref ref="Chap_Distributions"/> to make predictions about the original random variable.  </p>

        <p>
          In this section, we identify point estimates for true parameters.

          <title>Point Estimates vs Parameters of interest</title>


 <definition>
          <p>
            A statistic about a population we wish to measure or estimate is a <em>parameter of interest</em>.    An estimate of that statistic is a <em>point estimate</em>.  The difference between the  the point estimate and the parameter of interest (positive or negative) is the <em>error</em>.  The <em> sampling error</em> is how much the error will tend to vary between samples.  The <em>sample size</em> is the size of the sample.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Bias</em> describes a systematic tendency to over or underestimate the true population value.  We use the sampling techniques in <xref ref="Chap_DataBasics"/> to minimize bias.

              To predict the mean weight of Male African Elephants, 100 Male African Elephants were weighed, and the average of these 100 elephants was 6175 kg.  The actual mean weight of Male African  Elephants is 6300 kg.

                  <p>Suppose that the proportion of American adults who support the expansion of solar energy were 88%.  If we sampled 1000 random American's, we wouldn't neccesarily expect exactly 88% of them to support Solar Energy would we?

          <remark>
            <p>
              Notice that  every time we sampled, we get a potentially different proportion of respondents who support solar energy.  Thus, the proportion of respondents who support solar energy (<m>\hat{p}</m>) is a <em>random variable</em> and thus has a mean, and a standard deviation.  We will call this standard deviation the <em>standard error</em> as it measure the tendency of <m>\hat{p}</m> to deviate from it's mean.</p>

              <p>
                In general, we call <m>\hat{p}</m> the <em>sample proportion</em> or the proportion of a sample which satisfies some condition, which is a point-estimate for <m>p</m> the population proportion (which satisfies the same condition). The distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is the <em>sampling distribution</em>.

              <title>The Central Limit Theorem (Proportion)</title>

                For a sufficiently large sample (typically <m>pn, (1-p)n\geq 10</m> or at least 10 <q>successes</q> and <q>failures</q>) the sampling distribution of<m>\hat{p}</m> is approximately <em>normally distributed</em> with pararmeters <me>\mu_{\hat{p}}=p,\ \ \  SE_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}.</me>
