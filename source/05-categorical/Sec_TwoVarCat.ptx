        	<title>Gender and Raises</title>
        	<introduction>
        	    <p>A watchdog group concerned about gender discrimination at a company randomly polls 528 of the company's employees, 312  men and 216  women.  At the end of last year of those surveyed, 102 employees recieved raises: 72 men and 30 women.  The watchdog group points out that the proportion of men who got raises is significantly greater than the proportion of women who got raises and suggests this is due to inequitable practices within the company.  The company claims that any difference between the rates and men and women getting raises is purely by random chance.</p>

	<title>Confidence Intervals for Differences of Proportions</title>

	<remark xml:id="remark-CIfordiffprop">
		<p>
			Following the same reasoning as in <xref ref="Sec_ConfidenceInterval"/> we can compute a confidence interval for the differences of true proportions.  Suppose you had two categorical variables from whom you collect samples of size <m>n_1, n_2</m> and obtain sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1, \hat{p}_2</m>.  Then a C% confidence interval for the difference between the true proportions <m>D=p_1-p_2</m> is an interval centered at <m>d=\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> which has a C% chance of containing D.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can compute this interval to be <me>[(p_1-p_2)-z^*SE_D, (p_1-p_2)+z^*SE_D]</me> where <m>SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}</m> as in <xref ref="remark-diffofprop"/> and <m>z^*</m> is found as in <xref ref="remark-otherCI"/>:

			<me>
              \begin{array}{|c|c|}
              \hline
              C\% \amp z^*\\
              \hline
              90\% \amp 1.645\\
              95\% \amp 1.96\\
              99\% \amp 2.576 \\
              \hline
              \end{array}
            </me>
        </p>
	</remark>

	

	<example xml:id="example-genderdisc">
	    <title>Gender and Raises revisted again</title>
	    <p>
	    	We recall from <xref ref="exploration-genderdisc"/> that we had <m>n_1=312</m> men whose sample raise rate was <m>\hat{p_1}=\frac{72}{312}</m> and there were <m>n_2=216</m> women whose sample raise rate was <m>\hat{p_2}=\frac{30}{216}</m>.  In this Activity, we also found that <me>SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{\frac{72}{312}\left(1-\frac{72}{312}\right)}{312}+\frac{\frac{30}{216}\left(1-\frac{30}{216}\right)}{216}}\approx 0.033506. </me>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The differences between the sample proportions is <me>d=\frac{72}{312}-\frac{30}{216}\approx 0.09188.</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		So we could compute a 95% confidence interval for the differences of proportions by 
		<md>
		<mrow>\amp[(p_1-p_2)-z^*SE_D, (p_1-p_2)+z^*SE_D]</mrow>
		<mrow>\amp \approx [0.09188-1.96\cdot 0.033506, 0.09188+1.96\cdot 0.033506]</mrow>
		<mrow>\amp \approx[0.0262, 0.1576].</mrow>
		</md>

		That is, there is a 95% chance that the difference in raise rates between men and women is between 2.62% and 15.76%.  Note that the companies claim was that raise rates were the same, that is, <em>the difference in raise rates was zero</em> which seems unlikely, given this evidence.

	<title>Hypothesis Testing with two Categorical Variables</title>

	<remark xml:id="remark-hypothesistestdiffofprop">
		<p>
			We approach Hypothesis Testing of the difference of proportion variables in a similar spirit to <xref ref="remark-stepsofHT"/>.  From <xref ref="remark-diffofprop"/>, we let <m>D</m> be the difference in sample proportions generated by samples of size <m>n_1, n_2</m> from variables with true proportions <m>p_1, p_2</m>.  Then our alternative hypothesis take the form of:

			<ol>
				<li><m>H_A:p_1-p_2\lt p_0</m></li>
				<li><m>H_A:p_1-p_2> p_0</m></li>
				<li><m>H_A:p_1-p_2\neq p_0</m></li>
			</ol>

			We note here <m>p_1-p_2=\mu_D</m>.  The null hypothesis for all of these is <m>H_0: p_1-p_2=p_0</m>.  
		</p>

		<p>Then, given an observed differnce in proportions: <m>d=\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}</m> we compute the <m>p</m>-values by <em>assuming the null hypothesis <m>p_1-p_2=p_0</m></em> and then computing:

		<ol>
				<li><m>P(D\lt d)</m></li>
				<li><m>P(D> d)</m></li>
				<li><m>P(|D-p_0|> |d-p_0|)</m></li>
			</ol>
			Note that we compute these by finding the areas of a right, left or both tails as in <xref ref="definition-pvalue"/>.
		</p>
	</remark>


	<remark xml:id="remark-diffiszero">
		<p>
			If the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1-p_2=0</m>, which is to say <m>p_1=p_2</m>, then this is what is assumed when we assume the null hypothesis.  If both populations have the same proportion, then we may as well treat it as one big population.  So if we take samples of size <m>n_1, n_2</m> and have <q>successes</q> <m>x_1, x_2</m>, then e then compute a <q>pooled</q> sample proportion: <me>\hat{p}_{pool}=\frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}.</me>
			We then use this pooled proportion as both <m>\hat{p_1}</m> and <m>\hat{p_2}</m> for the purpose of computing the standard error.

		</p>
		<p>
			So we would use <me>SE_D=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\hat{p}_{pool})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\hat{p}_{pool})}{n_2}}.</me>

	    <title>Cancer in Dogs</title>
	    <introduction>
	        <p>A study in 1994 examined 491 dogs that had developed cancer and 945 dogs as a control group to determine whether there is an <em>increased</em> risk of cancer in dogs that are exposed to the herbicide 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).  We analyze their data and see what their conclusion would be.</p>
