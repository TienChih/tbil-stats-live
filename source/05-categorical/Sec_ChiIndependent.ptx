    <title>Chi-Squared Test and Independence (C4)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> In this section, we compare samples from two different populations, to see if the populations may have the same distribution.  In other words, are the outcomes equally likely, no matter which population I draw from?

      <title>OER vs Predatory Publishers and Student Access</title>

      <introduction>
          <p>Students across different sections of the same course are assigned  different texts.  Some students are assigned free OER resources as their text, and others are assigned overpriced  texts from predatory publishers.  After 2 weeks the professors take a random anonymous poll of their classes to see how many students have managed to begun the assigned readings in their respective texts.  The results are as follows:  <me>
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Sample Frequency} \amp \text{Has Done Reading} \amp \text{Has Not Yet Done Reading} \\
\hline
\text{OER} \amp 66 \amp 14 \\
\hline
\text{Predatory Publisher} \amp 112 \amp 58 \\
\hline

\end{array}
</me>
One professor claims that this constitutes a clear difference between the type of resource assigned to students and whether or not they can complete their assigned tasks.  Their colleague dismisses it and says any difference is purely due to random chance, and the type of material has no impact on student accesibility, in other words these things are independent.

      <title>Testing for Independence</title>


      <remark xml:id="remark-chiteststatind">
        <title>Test statistics for <m>\chi^2</m> tests for independence</title>
        
            <p>When we test to see if the distributions of a variable is independent of which population it comes from, we approach this very similarly to when we did so in <xref ref="remark-chiteststat"/>.  In <xref ref="remark-chiteststat"/>, we quantify the difference between the frequencies of the sample and the expected frequencies of the outcomes if we assumed they came from a certain distribution.  <em>Here</em>, we will quantify the difference between the frequencies of the sample and the expected frequencies of the outcomes if we assumed distributions and populations were different.</p>

            <p>
              Suppose we had <m>\ell</m> populations <m>P_1, \ldots, P_\ell</m>, from which each random variable has <m>k</m> outcomes <m>O_1,\ldots O_k</m>.  We also have a sample of size <m>n</m> where the frequency of occurences from Population <m>i</m> and Outcome <m>j</m> is <m>n_{i,j}</m>:  <me>
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Sample Frequency} \amp O_1 \amp O_2 \amp \cdots \amp O_k  \\
\hline
P_1 \amp n_{1,1} \amp n_{1,2} \amp \cdots \amp n_{1,k} \\
\hline
P_2 \amp n_{2,1} \amp n_{2,2} \amp \cdots \amp n_{2,k} \\
\hline
\vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\
\hline
P_\ell \amp n_{\ell,1} \amp n_{\ell,2} \amp \cdots \amp n_{\ell,k} \\
\hline
\end{array}
</me>

            </p>

            <p>
              We first note that the probability that if we selected an arbitrary data point from this sample, the probability it has Population <m>P_i</m>  is the sum of row <m>i</m> divided by <m>n</m> the size of the sample. Similarly, the probability it has Outcome <m>O_j</m>  is the sum of column <m>j</m> divided by <m>n</m> the size of the sample.  From this, <em>IF</em> we were to assume events <m>P_i, O_j</m> were independent, we would have <m>P(P_i\cap O_j)=P(P_i)P(O_j)</m> and the expected number of occurences from a sample of size <m>n</m> from Population <m>P_i</m> with Outcome <m>O_j</m> is: <me>E_{i,j}=n\cdot P(P_i)P(O_j)=n\cdot \frac{\text{sum of row $i$}}{n}\frac{\text{sum of column $j$}}{n}=\frac{\text{sum of row $i$}\cdot \text{sum of column $j$}}{n}.</me>  From here we can compute a table of <em>expected frequencys</em>.  <me>
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Expected Frequency} \amp O_1 \amp O_2 \amp \cdots \amp O_k  \\
\hline
P_1 \amp E_{1,1} \amp E_{1,2} \amp \cdots \amp E_{1,k} \\
\hline
P_2 \amp E_{2,1} \amp E_{2,2} \amp \cdots \amp E_{2,k} \\
\hline
\vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\
\hline
P_\ell \amp E_{\ell,1} \amp E_{\ell,2} \amp \cdots \amp E_{\ell,k} \\
\hline
\end{array}
</me>

            </p>

            <p>
              Then, much like <xref ref="remark-chiteststat"/>, <m>Z_{i,j}</m> computes the test statistic for <m>P_i\cap O_j</m> and is computed in a similar way: <me>Z_{i,j}=\frac{n_{i,j}-E_{i,j}}{\sqrt{E_{i,j}}}.
            </me>
            Then once again <m>\chi^2</m> is the sum of the squares of the <m>Z_{i,j}</m>:<me>\chi^2=\sum Z_{i,j}^2.</me>

            <title>Steps to <m>\chi^2</m> Hypothesis Testing: Independence</title>
            <p>
              Given the set of hypothesis:
              <ul>
            <li><m>H_0</m>:<q>The outcomes are independent of the populations.</q></li>
            <li><m>H_A</m>:<q>The outcomes are <em>not</em> independent of the populations.</q></li>
          </ul>
            We compute the <m>p</m>-value to be the area of the tail on the <m>\chi^2</m> distribution corresponding to the <m>\chi^2</m> value computed via <xref ref="remark-chiteststatind"/> and with <m>(k-1)(\ell-1)</m> degrees of freedom (recall that <m>k</m> is the number of possible values of the categorical variable.)
          </p>
          <p>
            As in other hypothesis testing scenarios, the <m>p</m>-value measures the probability that, if we assume the null hypothesis, that we see values as or more extreme than what was observed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then reject or accept the null based on the level of significance <m>\alpha</m> which is as before usually 0.05 or 5%.  If the <m>p</m>-value is less than <m>\alpha</m>, we reject the null hypothesis, otherwise we accept it.  In this context, accepting the null is to say the the populations and outcomes are independent.  If we reject that then we say it is implausible that they are.
