    <title>Size of Samples (C1)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> We saw in <xref ref="remark-otherCI"/> that we can increase the likelihood the true proportion falls within our intervals, so long as we sacrifice precision and widen our intervals.  But what if we demand both dependability <em>and</em> precision?</p>

        <p>
          In this section, we identify the sample sizes neccesary to achieve confidence intervals with a given margin of error.

              <introduction>
                  <p>A professor is deciding whether to offer a course face-to-face, or online, and wishes to find a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of students who would prefer it to be online.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Recall that the pieces neccesary to compute a 99% confidence interval are: <m>\hat{p}</m> the sample proportion, <m>n</m> the sample size, <m>SE_{\hat{p}}</m> the standard error, and <m>z^*</m> the <m>z</m>-score associated with the 99% interval.
                </p>
                  
              </introduction>

                <p>
                  Which one of the follwing factors is <em>directly</em> under the professors control?

                    <li><m>z^*</m>.</li> 
                    <li>The 99% Confidence Interval.</li>

          <remark>
            <p>
              We note that the interval we found <xref ref="exploration-modality"/> is quite wide!  If the professor wanted to narrow it down, the only thing under their control is how many students they survey.

                Given a confidence interval <m>[LB, UB]</m>  the point estimate (in this chapter <m>\hat{p}</m>) is halfway between the lower bound and upper bound <m>\frac{UB-LB}{2}</m>.
