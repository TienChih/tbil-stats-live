    <title>Chi-Squared Test and Goodness of Fit (C3)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> In previous sections, we discuss the proportion of a categorical variable which takes on a certain value.  In this section, we look at the distribution of a sample of a categorical variable across all it's values.  In particular, we see if a sample can plausibly come from a given distribution for the variable.

        <p>There is a clear follow-up question to be asked here.  <q>Does the jury pool match the demographics of the town?</q> Certainly, a random sample of 300 people need not match the expected demographics exactly.  But the more it deviates from the town demographics, the less likely we are to be inclined to think that these demographics match.</p>

          In the language of Hypothesis Testing, this section is focused on  null and alternative hypothesis of the following form:  Given a proposed distribution for a categorical variable...
          <ul>
            <li><m>H_0</m>:<q>The sample comes from the proposed distribution.</q></li>

      <title>The chi-square distribution</title>

      <remark xml:id="remark-chiteststat">
      <p>
        So suppose we did assume the null hypothesis that a sample comes from a certain distribution.  We essentially want to develop a measure of how far this sample deviates from the proposed distribution.  If it's a little, it's plausible it may come from the null distribution.  If it's a significant deviation, we reject the idea that this is the distribution from where the sample comes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose that we did have a random variable with <m>k</m> possible outcomes: <m>O_1, \ldots O_k</m>, and a sample with <m>n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k</m> data points corresponding to each outcome.  Note that the total size of the sample is <m>n=n_1+\cdots n_k</m>.  Let <m>E_1, \ldots, E_k</m> denote the <em>expected</em> number of outcomes for each value, if a sample of size <m>n</m> were taken from the proposed distribution.  <me>
\begin{array}{|r|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 \text{Outcomes:} \amp O_1 \amp O_2 \amp \cdots \amp O_k \\
\hline
\text{Sample Frequency:} \amp n_1 \amp n_2 \amp \cdots \amp n_k \\
\hline
\text{Expected Frequency:} \amp E_1 \amp E_2 \amp \cdots \amp E_k \\
\hline
\end{array}
</me> We then compute the test statistic for the <m>i</m>th value is <me>Z_i=\frac{n_i-E_i}{\sqrt{E_i}}.</me>  
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we compute <me>\chi^2=Z_1^2+\cdots Z_k^2=\frac{(n_1-E_1)^2}{E_1}+\cdots+\frac{(n_k-E_k)^2}{E_k}.</me>  This removes the distinction between over and undershooting the expectations, and sums the adjusted error for all the values, which gives a measure for the <q>total</q> deviation from the theoritical expectation.

            <title>Steps to <m>\chi^2</m> Hypothesis Testing: Goodness of Fit</title>
            <p>
              Given the set of hypothesis:
              <ul>
            <li><m>H_0</m>:<q>The sample comes from the proposed distribution.</q></li>
            <li><m>H_A</m>:<q>The sample <em>does not</em> come from the proposed distribution.</q></li>
          </ul>
            We compute the <m>p</m>-value to be the area of the tail on the <m>\chi^2</m> distribution corresponding to the <m>\chi^2</m> value computed via <xref ref="remark-chiteststat"/> and with <m>k-1</m> degrees of freedom (recall that <m>k</m> is the number of possible values of the categorical variable.)
          </p>
          <p>
            As in other hypothesis testing scenarios, the <m>p</m>-value measures the probability that, if we assume the null hypothesis, that we see values as or more extreme than what was observed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then reject or accept the null based on the level of significance <m>\alpha</m> which is as before usually 0.05 or 5%.  If the <m>p</m>-value is less than <m>\alpha</m>, we reject the null hypothesis, otherwise we accept it.  In this context, accepting the null is to say the sample could plausibly come from the proposed distribution.  If we reject that then we say it is implausible that it does.

            <introduction>
                <p>
                We examine data from a random selection of adult males to see if their heights are possibly normally distributed.

              <p>
                Run the following code to download the <c>male_heights.csv</c> data set and to display it's variables.

                We begin by examining the heights of adult males in inches.  Run the following code to see the sample mean and standard deviation for the heights of adult males in inches, and set them to be <c>m</c> and <c>std</c> respectively.

                <alert>IF</alert> adult male heights were normally distributed, we would expect it to be approximated by a normal random variable <m>X</m> with mean <m>\mu=m</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma=std</m>.
