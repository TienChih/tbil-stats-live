    <title>Interpreting Linear Regression (R2)</title>

   <introduction>
        <p> We've shown how to perform linear regression in <xref ref="Sec_Correlation"/>. In this section, we look at what the regression is telling us, what information we can draw from this analysis, and what we <em>can't</em> draw.

        <remark>
          <p>
            When modeling the relationship between two variables with a function (such as a linear function), the input (typically <m>x</m>m values) is called the <em>explanatory variable</em> and the output (typically <m>y</m> values) is called the <em>response variable</em>.  Recall <xref ref="definition-explanatoryresponse"/>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea is that one can measure the change in <m>y</m> as a <em>response</em> to changes in <m>x</m>.

            Since the <em>slope</em> of a line <m>\beta_1</m> is measured by the change in <m>y</m> over change in <m>x</m>, the units of the slope are: <me>\frac{\text{units of}\ y}{\text{units of}\ x}</me> and each increase in <m>x</m> by one unit results in a change of <m>y</m> by <m>\beta_1</m> units.
